# :tada: Welcome to GROWI 

GROWI is an internal wiki & knowledge base tool for corporations and individuals.  
With GROWI, members can easily share and edit information in a company, university seminar, or circle.

Casually writing down the information you know and editing it together can **reduce tacit knowledge within the team**.  
Let's increase the amount of information shared on a daily base!
